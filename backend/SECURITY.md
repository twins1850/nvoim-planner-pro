# Security Hardening and Compliance Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the 앤보임 영어회화 관리 시스템 backend to ensure data protection, system integrity, and compliance with security best practices.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Comprehensive Validation Middleware**: All API endpoints use the validation middleware to ensure data integrity and prevent injection attacks.
- **Schema-Based Validation**: Request bodies, parameters, and query strings are validated against predefined schemas.
- **Type Checking**: Strong type checking for all input data to prevent type confusion vulnerabilities.
- **Sanitization**: Input data is sanitized to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.

### 2. Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection

- **Global API Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests from a single IP address to prevent abuse.
- **Authentication Endpoint Protection**: Stricter rate limits on authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.
- **IP-Based Throttling**: Automatically throttles requests from IPs that exceed defined thresholds.
- **Configurable Limits**: Rate limits can be adjusted via environment variables.

### 3. Data Encryption

- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data stored in the database is encrypted using AES-256-GCM.
- **Encryption in Transit**: All API communications use HTTPS with TLS 1.2+.
- **Secure Key Management**: Encryption keys are stored securely and rotated regularly.
- **S3 Server-Side Encryption**: All files stored in S3 use AES-256 server-side encryption.

### 4. Security Headers and CORS

- **Helmet Integration**: Comprehensive security headers including:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Referrer-Policy
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict CORS policy that only allows requests from whitelisted origins.
- **Cache Control**: Prevents sensitive data from being cached by browsers.

### 5. Audit Logging

- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: All sensitive operations are logged with detailed context.
- **User Activity Tracking**: User actions are tracked for accountability and forensic analysis.
- **Immutable Logs**: Logs cannot be modified or deleted to ensure integrity.
- **Structured Logging**: Logs are structured for easy querying and analysis.
- **PII Protection**: Personal Identifiable Information is redacted from logs.

### 6. Data Backup and Recovery

- **Automated Backups**: Database backups are performed automatically on a scheduled basis.
- **Encrypted Backups**: All backups are encrypted before storage.
- **Secure Storage**: Backups are stored in a secure S3 bucket with strict access controls.
- **Retention Policy**: Backups are retained according to a defined retention policy.
- **Recovery Testing**: Regular tests of the backup and recovery process.

### 7. Security Vulnerability Assessment

- **Automated Security Scanning**: Regular automated security scans to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Vulnerability Checking**: Monitoring of dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **Security Headers Verification**: Verification of security headers implementation.
- **Environment Variable Security**: Checking for missing or weak environment variables.
- **File Permission Auditing**: Verification of secure file permissions.

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT-Based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with short-lived access tokens.
- **Refresh Token Rotation**: Refresh tokens are rotated on each use to prevent token theft.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained access control based on user roles.
- **Password Security**: Strong password hashing using bcrypt with appropriate work factors.
- **Password Strength Validation**: Enforcing strong password policies.

### API Security

- **Input Validation**: All API inputs are validated and sanitized.
- **Output Encoding**: All API responses are properly encoded to prevent XSS.
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks.
- **HTTPS Only**: All API communications are encrypted using HTTPS.

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected and stored.
- **Access Controls**: Strict access controls for sensitive data.
- **Data Retention**: Clear policies for data retention and deletion.
- **Secure File Handling**: Secure handling of uploaded files.

## Security Scripts and Tools

The following scripts are available to help maintain security:

```bash
# Run security assessment
npm run security:assessment

# Run npm audit and save results
npm run security:audit

# Create database backup
npm run backup:create

# List available backups
npm run backup:list
```

## Security Configuration

Security settings can be configured through environment variables. See `.env.example` for available options.

Key security-related environment variables:

```
# Security Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key-at-least-32-chars-long
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-jwt-refresh-secret-key-at-least-32-chars-long
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key-in-hex-format-64-chars-long
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://app.anboim.com,https://planner.anboim.com,https://student.anboim.com

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=1000

# Backup Configuration
AWS_BACKUP_BUCKET=your-backup-bucket-name
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=30
```

## Security Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. Identify and isolate affected systems
2. Assess the impact and scope of the breach
3. Contain the breach and prevent further damage
4. Collect and preserve evidence
5. Notify affected parties as required by law
6. Remediate vulnerabilities and restore systems
7. Review and update security measures

## Regular Security Maintenance

- Run `npm run security:assessment` weekly to identify potential vulnerabilities
- Keep all dependencies updated with `npm update` and regularly check for vulnerabilities with `npm audit`
- Review and rotate access keys and secrets quarterly
- Test backup and recovery procedures monthly
- Review audit logs regularly for suspicious activity

## Compliance Considerations

This implementation follows security best practices aligned with:

- OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks
- GDPR data protection principles
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- CIS Critical Security Controls
